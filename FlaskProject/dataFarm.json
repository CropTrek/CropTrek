Rotted or dwarfed plants may be due to thecarrot rust fly. The maggots of this fly are often found chewing on the roots. If your plants are stunted and the leaves are yellow, suspectnematodes. Unlike beneficial nematodes, these microscopic pests attack the roots of the plant causing galls (swelling) to develop. Protect emerging seedlings from birds,snails and slugs. If seedlings topple over, suspect damping off.
